'''
You are given an array of size N. Rearrange the given array in-place such that all the negative numbers occur before all non-nagative numbers.(Maintain the order of all -ve and non-negative numbers as given in the original array).
Example 1:

Input:
N = 4
Arr[] = {-3, 3, -2, 2}
Output:
-3 -2 3 2
Explanation:
In the given array, negative numbers
are -3, -2 and non-negative numbers are 3, 2. 
Example 1:

Input:
N = 4
Arr[] = {-3, 1, 0, -2}
Output:
-3 -2 1 0
Explanation:
In the given array, negative numbers
are -3, -2 and non-negative numbers are 1, 0.
Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function Rearrange() which takes the array Arr[] and its size N as inputs and returns the array after rearranging with spaces between the elements of the array.
Expected Time Complexity: O(N. Log(N))
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(Log(N))

Constraints:
1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 105
-109 â‰¤ Elements of array â‰¤ 109
