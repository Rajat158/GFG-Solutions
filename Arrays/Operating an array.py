'''
Given an array A of size N, your task is to do some operations, i.e., search an element, insert an element, and delete an element by completing the functions. Also, all functions should return a boolean value.

Note: In delete operation return true even if element is not present.

Example:

Input:
5
2 4 1 0 6
1 2 2 0
Output:
1 1 1
Your Task:
Since this is a function problem, you only need to complete the provided functions.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 100
0 <= Ai <= 1000
'''
#Solution-->
# Your task is to complete all
# three functions

# if the element is found in the list
# function  must return true or else
# return false
def searchEle(a, x):
    # Code here

# fucntion must return true if 
# insertion is successful or else
# return false
def insertEle(a, y, yi):
    # Code here

# fucntion must return true if 
# deletion is successful or else
# return false
def deleteEle(a, z):
    # Code here
